# Handling Class Imbalance in Continual Learning based Network Intrusion Detection System
In this work, we try handling infamous **class imbalance problem** frequently seen in intrusion detection datasets. Specifically, we study this problem under the application of **continual learning (CL)** to the intrusion detection. Under CL paradigm, the learning model will be more flexible to adapt to the newly seen attack pattern with minimal overhead.
